# python2-rev
The Python 2 Revival Project's goal is to continue maintaining Python 2 for legacy scipts that still require Python 2.

# Why should we care about Python 2?
In 2020, Python 2 was discontinued, and no further updates will ever be released for it...Except if the community doesn't intervene. Although Python 2 has numerous security vulnerabilities, we hope to fix these by importing some Python 3 code.
